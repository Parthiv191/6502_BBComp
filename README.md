# üß† 6502 Breadboard Computer

A fully functional 8-bit computer built from the ground up on a breadboard using the **W65C02S** CPU.  
This project demonstrates key computer architecture principles ‚Äî including bus control, memory mapping, and timing ‚Äî implemented entirely with discrete components and a custom-built programming/debugging tool.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This project recreates a complete 6502 computer system using low-cost, readily available components.  
A custom microcontroller interface handles programming, memory writing, and logic-level debugging ‚Äî eliminating the need for expensive commercial analyzers or EEPROM programmers.

> üí° _Typical EEPROM programmers and logic analyzers can cost over $200. This system achieves the same functionality using a $10 microcontroller and open-source software._

The project is designed to be educational, replicable, and fully transparent ‚Äî ideal for anyone learning about computer architecture or interested in retro computing. _We are also learning, and would love to hear your feedback!_
